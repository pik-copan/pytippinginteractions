Authored by Ann Kristin Klose, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, 2018-2020.

These python scripts have been used to produce the analysis and figures presented in the following publication:

* A.K. Klose, V. Karle, R. Winkelmann, J.F. Donges,
Dynamic emergence of domino effects in systems of interacting tipping elements in ecology and climate,
in review (2020),
preprint arXiv:1910.12042 [physics.geo-ph].

More detailed information on the scripts:

1) StabilityMap_n2.py generates the stability maps in Fig. 4/5/6 of the main manuscript and in Fig. 1 of the Supplementary Material (with adjustments of parameter settings as indicated in the script).
2) StabilityMap_n3.py generates the stability maps in Fig. 7 of the main manuscript and in Fig. 2/3 of the Supplementary Material (with adjustments of parameter settings as indicated in the script).
3) LegendStabilityMap.py generates the colobars for the stability maps described above.
4) PhasePortrait_n3.py generates Fig. 8 of the main manuscript and Fig. 4/5 of the Supplementary Material (with adjustments of parameter settings as indicated in the script).
5) fold.py generates elements of Fig. 1 of the main manuscript and is used for the illustration of the tipping rules in Fig. 2/3 of the main manuscript.
